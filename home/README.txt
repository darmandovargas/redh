	* Bootstrap Local Business
	* Version: 1.0 from 10th April 2013
	* Author: appman


Installation and customization
-------------------------------
>	To change the initial location, in the index.html file find the lines...
    
    <meta name="geo.placename" content="WC1B, london">
	<meta name="geo.position" content="51.51954;-0.125549" />
	
	...and change it to your own location and latitude longitude.

> To change the fonts and colours
	In each directory inside the 'less/themes' directory there is a file 'color-scheme.less'. This enables you to easily change the colours of your site.

	A typical colour scheme looks like
	@bodyBackground:       	#232C3C;	//the background of the web page
	@textColor:            	#ffffff;	//the color of the text on the web page
	@directionsBackground: 	#232C3C;	//the color of the background for the directions box
	@directionsText: 		#fff;		//the color of the text for the directions box

	If you would like to customize it further, e.g. the fonts, you will need to modify variables.less.

> To compile
	Install WinLess http://winless.org/ (or any other compiler depending on the operating system)
	Add the folder 'less/' to the program
	Check only the bootstrap.less and bootstrap-responsive.less files and compile to the css folder



Description
------------
**Are you someone that has a local business, but haven't set up a website yet or want to renovate your website? Do you think most themes are too complicated to set up and doesnt have exactly what you want? Take a look at this business theme, it might meet your needs**

>Why use this theme?
>It's simple, clear and effective
>What most people want to know for brick and mortar businesses is where they're found and how to get to you. We have a big map for this and the user can simply enter his location and get driving/walking directions straight away.

>People also simply want to know how to contact you - the phone number/email address are right infront of their eyes. There are also links to social sites that you can take advantage of at the bottom of the page.

>The other thing is your pricing - The user can simply click on 'Services' to see what you provide and average/fixed costs. There's also room for othr pages such as Testimonials and a gallery if needed.

>Anyway, this is pretty much all that a user will want from you're website - all on one page! The site is also responsive - meaning people googleing your site on their mobiles won't have a problem getting your information.

>We've coded this in LESS so it's really easy to change the fonts and colour. We've even included 6 different colour schemes as examples for your barber, cafe, car repair company or any local business you may have.
